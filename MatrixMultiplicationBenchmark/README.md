## Benchmarking

The project includes benchmarking to assess performance and results, utilizing Java's testing capabilities. The provided code for benchmarking consists of test cases that evaluate the various matrix multiplication methods.

### DenseMatrixMultiplicationTest

This test suite evaluates the multiplication of two random dense matrices using different algorithms, including the standard algorithm, row-wise multiplication, transposed multiplication, streams, Executor Service, threads, synchronized blocks, semaphores, and atomic operations. It covers matrix sizes of 10, 100, and 1000.

### BigSparseMultiplicationTest

This test focuses on the multiplication of two MTX compressed matrices. It reads a specific MTX file (e.g., pdb1HYS.mtx), converts it into a suitable format, and multiplies the matrices using the Sparse Matrix Multiplication method. The result is then compared to the multiplication of dense matrices for verification.

Please ensure you have the required dependencies and configurations in place to run these tests effectively.

### Execution Time Parallel vs Sequential Methods
